## Introduction

### Overview
In a world where digital inclusion increasingly shapes social and economic landscapes, inclusive internet is now more vital than ever. This dashboard will explore the inclusivity of internet access, breaking it down to key facets: availability, affordability, relevance, and readiness, as well as present some trends associated with low or high inclusive internet access. This dashboard will focus on the Inclusive Internet Index as its main metric in assessing the global internet inclusiveness.

### About the Inclusive Internet Index
The inclusive Internet Index, an initiative by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and commissioned by Meta, seeks to measure the extent to which the Internet is not only accessible and affordable, but also relevant to all, allowing usage that enables positive social and economic outcomes at the individual and group level.

For more information regarding the Inclusive Internet Index, visit the [official Economist Impact webpage on the index](https://impact.economist.com/projects/inclusive-internet-index/about).

### Dataset
The dashboard uses data from the [2022 Inclusive Internet Index](https://impact.economist.com/projects/inclusive-internet-index/2022).

## Exploring The Dashboard

### Part One: Exploring the Countries with High & Low Indices.
In 2022, countries from Asia, Europe, and the US highlight the top 10 countries based on their inclusive internet index, with Singapore being the highest ranked that year. This information is presented using a combination of a bubble and bar chart in the dashboard. Above the top 10 countries chart, there is also a filter, which users can use to navigate between the overall score (Inclusive Internet Index) to scores focusing more on either of these 4 categories: Availability, Affordability, Relevance and Readiness.

Meanwhile, countries from Africa dominate the list of countries with the lowest inclusive internet index.

Below the top 10 and lowest 10 countries charts, there is a graph made of boxes, representing the growth/drop in the scores for each country, from the previous year. Just like to bubble & bar chart, these boxes are also controlled by the score category filter mentioned before.

### Part Two: Countries with High & Low Internet Access
In the top right corner of the dashboard, users can observe the countries with high and low internet access, based on the percentage of their population using internet.

### Part Three: Contributors to the Inclusive Internet Index
A country's inclusive internet index is assessed on 4 facets: Availability, Affordability, Relevance, and Readiness. Some of the most contributing factors are highligted on this chart in the dashboard.

### Part Four: Events Associated with High/ Low Inclusive Internet Index
A high inclusive internet index is associated with a higher level of literacy and GNI per capita, thus further shedding light on its importance.
